# Rent--Amount
This is a C project to find the cost of rent plus the heating cost the tenants of each apartment
have to pay. 

In this program, the user have to insert the number of the tenants, the total heating amount of the month
and the total rent cost of the month.

Then for every apartment, the user have to insert the name of the tenant, the square meters of the 
apartment and the radiator slices.

After inserting everything, a message will be displayed showing in a different row: 
The number of the apartment, the name of the tenant, the square meters of their apartment, the number 
of their radiator slices, the heat cost they have to pay, the rent amount they have to pay and finally
the total cost (heat + rent).

Beneath the message, is another message showing the total square meters, the total slices, the total heat
cost, the total rent amount and finally the total cost.
